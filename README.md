District Summary
  - Calculated the total number of schools
  - Calculated the total number of students
  - Calculated the average math score
  - Calculated the average reading score
  - Used coded provided to calculate the percentage of students who passed math
  - Calculated the percentage of students who passed reading
  - Used the code provided to calculate the percentage of students who passed math and reading
  - Created DataFrame of the above called district_summary
  - Used the above to create a high-level snapshot of key metrics
School Summary
  - Selected the school type
  - Calculate total students by school
  - Use code provided to calculate the total budget by school
  - Use code provided to calculate per capita spending by school
  - Calculated average test scores in math and reading by school
  - Calculated the percentage of students passing math by school
  - Calculated the percentage of students passing reading by school
  - Calculated the percentage of students passing math and reading by school
  - Created DataFrame to summarize the above school metrics
Highest-Preforming Schools(by % Overall Passing)
  - Sorted schools by "% Overall Passing" descending order
  - Display top 5 rows showing Highest-Performing Schools
  - Save the results in DataFrame called "top_schools"
Lowest-Preforming Schools(by % Overall Passing)
  - Sorted schools by "% Overall Passing" ascending order
  - Display top 5 rows showing lowest-Performing
  - Save the results in DataFrame called "bottom_schools"
Math Scores by Grade
  - Performed calculations necessary to create a DataFrame that listed the average math score for
    the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grades at each school
Reading Scores by Grade
  - Performed calculations necessary to create a DataFrame that listed the average reading score for
    the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grades at each school
Scores by School Spending
  - Created a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student)
  - Used pd.cut to categorize spending based on the bins
  - Used code provided to calculated the mean scored per spending range
  - Created DataFrame that included: average math score, average reading score, % passing math, % passing reading,
    % passing both math and reading
Scores by School Size
  - Used bins and labels provided to bin the per_school_summary
  - Used pd.cut on the "Total Students" column of the per_school_summary DataFrame
  - Created a DataFrame call size_summary that breaks down school performance by school size: Small, Medium or Large
Scores by School Type
  - Used the per_school_summary DataFrame to create a new DataFrame: type_summary
  - This dataframe shows school performance based on "School Type"
